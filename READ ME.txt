
# Problem Statement:-  
# Given an Image Represented by an N*N matrix. Write a Method to Rotate the image 
# by 90 degress. Can you do this in place ?


# Questions needed to ask before solving the problem.

>>>>>>> Do I need to rotate matrix Clock Wise or Anti Clock Wise ? 
>>>>>>> Do I need to rotoate in place ? 
>>>>>>> Verifying its square matrix ?
>>>>>>>	90 degree Rotation of Matrix ?

# My Own Assumptions 

>>>>>>>> Matrix is image taken as 4 bytes  
>>>>>>>> Rotating Matrix Anti-Clockwise 
>>>>>>>> Given Matrix is a Square Matrix 

One Approach to Implement:

>>>>> I solve by rotating outer most to rotating inner most layers.
>>>>> I am doing Four way swap using arrays
>>>>> Copying Top array of the matrix to right array of Matrix 
>>>>> Right Array to bottom array 
>>>>> Bottom array to left array
>>>>> Left Array to Top of Array of Matrix 
>>>>> Then I move into inner most and repeat the above steps.
